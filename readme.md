# MSD Task01 Segmentation Models Comparison

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various state-of-the-art deep learning models for 3D medical image segmentation, specifically focused on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) Task01 (Brain Tumor Segmentation). The code provides a comprehensive framework for comparing different segmentation approaches on the same dataset.

## Implemented Models

### 1. Attention U-Net

### 2. SegResNet

### 3. 3D U-Net

### 4. UNETR 

### 5. SwinUNETR

## Usage
Each model implementation is contained in its respective directory with training and inference scripts. Please refer to the specific model directories for detailed usage instructions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- MONAI 0.8+
- Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, etc.

## Acknowledgements
All implementations are based on the MONAI framework (Medical Open Network for AI), an open-source foundation for deep learning in healthcare imaging.
